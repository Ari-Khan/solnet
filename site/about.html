            <p>
              At synapse, we believe that identity can't be defined by just stats on a page. Through our extensive suite of badges, 
              we allow users to translate the multifaceted identity that they first showcase in real life into the virtual space. 
              Our collectible-style trading cards and badges system not only makes networking more engaging and fun to encourage lifelong connections,
              it also allows users to pursue new skills and identifiers that matter to them.
              Our modern world is ever-evolving, and synapse allows users to professionally evolve along it. 
              We are a team based in Toronto, Canada, aiming to bring out the best of networking, all wrapped in an easy-to-use UI.
